## Agents.md - AI Agent Development Brief

### Project Overview

Wellingborough.ai represents a groundbreaking fusion of artificial intelligence and traditional local marketing, designed to revolutionise how businesses connect with their community in Wellingborough and surrounding areas. This project brief outlines the development requirements for creating an AI-powered hyper-local platform that combines digital innovation with proven physical marketing methods.

The platform serves as a comprehensive ecosystem where local businesses can establish their digital presence, coordinate leaflet distribution campaigns, and engage with community members through AI-enhanced content and services. Unlike traditional business directories or marketing platforms, Wellingborough.ai leverages artificial intelligence to create unique, locally relevant content whilst maintaining the personal touch that characterises successful local business relationships.

### Core AI Agent Responsibilities

The AI agents within the Wellingborough.ai platform must handle multiple sophisticated tasks that require both technical precision and understanding of local business dynamics. These agents operate continuously to maintain platform quality, enhance user experience, and provide valuable insights to business owners and community members.

Content curation and enhancement represents one of the most critical AI functions within the platform. The AI agents must process information from multiple sources including RSS feeds from local news outlets, social media updates, council announcements, and business submissions, then transform this raw data into engaging, unique content that serves both users and search engines. This process requires sophisticated natural language processing capabilities that can maintain factual accuracy whilst creating original expressions of the same information.

The content enhancement process must consider multiple factors including local dialect and terminology, cultural references specific to Wellingborough and Northamptonshire, seasonal relevance, and the target audience for each piece of content. For instance, when processing a council announcement about road works, the AI must rewrite the information in accessible language whilst highlighting the specific impact on local businesses and residents, perhaps suggesting alternative routes or highlighting businesses that might benefit from increased foot traffic during the disruption.

Business intelligence and analytics represent another crucial area where AI agents provide substantial value. These agents must analyse patterns in user behaviour, business performance metrics, seasonal trends, and competitive dynamics to provide actionable insights to business owners. The analytics must go beyond simple traffic statistics to provide meaningful recommendations about optimal timing for leaflet campaigns, content strategies that resonate with local audiences, and opportunities for cross-promotion with complementary businesses.

The AI agents must also handle sophisticated personalisation tasks, learning from user interactions to provide increasingly relevant recommendations for businesses, events, and content. This personalisation must respect privacy boundaries whilst delivering genuine value, helping users discover new local businesses that match their interests and needs whilst helping businesses reach their ideal customers more effectively.

### Technical Implementation Requirements

The AI agents must be built using modern machine learning frameworks that can handle the diverse requirements of natural language processing, data analysis, and real-time decision making. The implementation should leverage cloud-based AI services where appropriate whilst maintaining local processing capabilities for sensitive operations and ensuring consistent performance regardless of external service availability.

Natural language processing capabilities must include text summarisation, content rewriting, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition specifically trained on local business and community content. The models must understand context sufficiently to maintain accuracy when transforming technical council documents into user-friendly summaries or converting business descriptions into engaging marketing copy.

Computer vision capabilities are essential for processing business photographs, automatically categorising images, detecting quality issues, and suggesting improvements. The AI must be able to identify business types from photographs, ensure images meet quality standards, and flag content that might require human review.

Data integration and processing capabilities must handle multiple API connections, RSS feed parsing, and real-time data synchronisation whilst maintaining system performance and reliability. The AI agents must implement intelligent caching strategies, error handling, and fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent operation even when external data sources experience issues.

### Quality Assurance and Monitoring

AI agent performance must be continuously monitored to ensure accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction. This includes implementing feedback loops that allow the system to learn from user interactions, business owner corrections, and community engagement patterns. The monitoring system must track key performance indicators including content accuracy, user engagement rates, business satisfaction scores, and platform growth metrics.

Error detection and correction mechanisms must identify when AI-generated content requires human review or correction. This includes detecting factual inconsistencies, inappropriate tone or language, and content that might be misleading or harmful to businesses or community members. The system must maintain audit trails for all AI decisions to enable continuous improvement and accountability.

### Integration with Human Operations

The AI agents must work seamlessly with human operators who handle complex customer service issues, business verification processes, and strategic decision making. The AI should identify situations that require human intervention whilst handling routine tasks autonomously. This hybrid approach ensures that the platform maintains the personal touch that local businesses and communities value whilst benefiting from AI efficiency and scalability.

Training and support systems must enable human operators to understand AI recommendations and override AI decisions when necessary. The platform must provide clear explanations for AI-generated content and recommendations, allowing human operators to maintain quality control and make informed decisions about platform operations.
