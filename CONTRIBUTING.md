## üéØ Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React/Next.js
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize for performance (memoization, lazy loading)
- Follow React best practices

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow the established design system
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic HTML elements

### Code Organization
```typescript
// Good: Clear, typed component
interface BusinessCardProps {
  business: Business;
  onContact: (businessId: string) => void;
}

export function BusinessCard({ business, onContact }: BusinessCardProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Write integration tests for components
- Test user interactions and edge cases
- Aim for good test coverage

Example test:
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { BusinessCard } from './BusinessCard'

describe('BusinessCard', () => {
  it('displays business name and description', () => {
    const mockBusiness = {
      id: '1',
      name: 'Test Business',
      description: 'A test business'
    }
    
    render(<BusinessCard business={mockBusiness} onContact={jest.fn()} />)
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Business')).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByText('A test business')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```
